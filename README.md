Colossal Cave Adventure in Java for GDQ AP Computer Science A 2020-21 school year

I teach AP Computer Science A at GDQ High School in Tirana, Albania. Our class needs a project for units 5-7 of the CSAwesome curriculum.

Students will reproduce the basics of the Colossal Cave Adventure game.

They must read in the content from a file rather than hardcoding the room definitions.

The available adventure.yaml file is too complicated for first-year computer science students to reasonably read/parse.

Thus I wrote this project to read adventure.yaml (slightly edited) and output file.txt (available in this repository).
